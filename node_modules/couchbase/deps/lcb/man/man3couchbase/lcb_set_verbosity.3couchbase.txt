NAME
----
lcb_set_verbosity - Set verbosity level on a node

SYNOPSIS
--------
cc [ flag ... ] file... -lcouchbase [ library ... ]

    #include <libcouchbase/couchbase.h>

    lcb_error_t lcb_verbosity(lcb_t instance,
                              const void *command_cookie,
                              lcb_size_t num,
                              const lcb_verbosity_cmd_t *const *commands);


DESCRIPTION
-----------
lcb_set_verbosity() is used to change the verbosity level on the
cluster. If the library instance is using asynchronous mode (the
default) this operation will return immediately and schedule the
operations to be executed by the event loop, otherwise it will block
until all commands are executed.  command_cookie is is an opaque field
that will be provided to the callback function. num is the number of
entries in the commands array.

lcb_verbosity_cmd_t is a structure defined in <libcouchbase/arguments.h>:

    typedef struct lcb_verbosity_cmd_st {
        int version;              /* The enty in "v" to use */
        union {
            struct {
                const char *server; /* The server to modify (or NULL for all) */
                lcb_verbosity_level_t level; /* The new level */
            } v0;
        } v;
    };


Upon completion the verbosity callback as set by
lcb_set_verbosity_callback(3couchbase) is called. The callback is
called multiple times. See lcb_set_verbosity_callback(3couchbase) for
more information about verbosity callbacks.

Verbosity levels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following levels is defined:

    LCB_VERBOSITY_DETAIL    This is the most verbose level and
                            generates a lot of output. Using
                            this level will impact the clusters
                            performance.


    LCB_VERBOSITY_DEBUG     This level generates a lot of output.
                            Using this level will impact the
                            clusters performance.

    LCB_VERBOSITY_INFO      This level trace all commands and
                            generates a fair amount of output.
                            Depending on the workload it may
                            slow down the system a little bit.


    LCB_VERBOSITY_WARNING   This is the default level and only
                            errors and warnings will be logged.

RETURN VALUES
-------------
lcb_verbosity() returns the LCB_SUCCESS on success, or a specific
error code upon failure.  See lcb_strerror(3couchbase) for more
information.

EXAMPLES
--------
         #include <libcouchbase/couchbase.h>

         ...
         lcb_t instance;
         ...
         lcb_verbosity_cmd_t *verbosity = calloc(1, sizeof(*verbosity));
         verbosity->version = 0;
         verbosity->v.v0.level = LCB_VERBOSITY_INFO;
         lcb_verbosity_cmd_t* commands[] = { verbosity };
         lcb_verbosity(instance, NULL, 1, commands);
         ...
